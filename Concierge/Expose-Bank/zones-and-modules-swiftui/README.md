# Zones and Modules Swift UI

This project is to show how simple it is to display Flybits Concierge using Swift UI language.

The [ContentView](ContentView.swift) file has two buttons and a Concierge instance below the buttons.

When the project/scheme zones-and-modules-swiftui runs, it will load the ContentView code which will show the below screen:

Once the connect happens it will makethe Concierge refresh to fetch the content and display it.
Same effect for the disconnect event which will return the Concierge to the empty state.
