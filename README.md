# iOS Samples
The idea of this repository is to provide a variety of iOS sample codes using Flybits SDKs.
All samples provided here will require you to have at least a tenant/project created on [Flybits Developer Portal](https://devportal.flybits.com/)

# Connection
It is possible to connect to Flybits via multiple interfaces, that's why we have the `IDP` protocol. Not only the protocol but the SDKs provide a gamma of embbed options such like:

- [AnonymousIDP](Connection/Anonymous-Connect)
-
