# iOS Samples
The idea of this repository is to provide a variety of iOS sample codes using Flybits SDKs.
All samples provided here will require you to have at least a tenant/project created on [Flybits Developer Portal](https://devportal.flybits.com/)

# Connection
It is possible to connect to Flybits via multiple interfaces, that's why we have the `IDP` protocol. Not only the protocol but the SDKs provide a gamma of embbed options such like:

- [AnonymousIDP](Connection/Anonymous-Connect)

# Zones N Modules
Samples to show how to integrate with Concierge 5.

- Via [Storyboard](Concierge/Expose-Bank/zones-and-modules-storyboard)
- Via [SwiftUI](Concierge/Expose-Bank/zones-and-modules-swiftui)

# Push Notifications
Sample with the necessary code to register for pushes and handle it

- Sample [Push Register N Receive](Concierge/Expose-Bank/push-register-n-receive/)
